<h2>Input formats</h2>

<h3>Barcodes file</h3>

<p>
The barcodes file format is very flexible. It can contain any number of 
whitespace-separated columns where the last column contains your SNP barcode data. This 
is the only column that COIL is currently aware of. An example of appropriate input 
file format is given below. Right-click the file below and select 'Save Link As' to 
store the file locally on your computer.
</p>

<p><a href="sample.txt">Sample barcode data input file</a></p>

<h3>Allele frequencies file</h3>
<p>
These are optional because COIL can calculate the minor allele
frequencies (MAF) for each assay from the 
barcodes. <b>However,</b> there are the following caveats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should include as many barcodes from one population as possible.</li>
  <li>It is very important to include barcodes that do not not include
  heterogenomic calls. These are used to calibrate the MAFs.</li>
  <li>Using a different set of barcodes <b>will</b> result in
  different output if the esimated MAFs for each assay change.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The MAFs file contains three columns. The first two are the two alleles possible for 
that assay of the barcode, the third column is the allele frequency of the allele in 
the first column.

<h2>Output format</h2>

<p>Output is tab-delimited text, with columns providing the following information for
each sample:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sample barcode sequence</li>
  <li>Estimated COI</li>
  <li>COI credible interval</li>
  <li>Posterior probability of the estimated COI value</li>
</ol>

<p>
The predictions are output in the same order as the input file. The estimated COI is 
the "maximal a posteriori" COI, the COI which has the greates probability in the 
constructed posterior distribution. This probability is provided in the last column.
</p>

<p>
The credible interval is the Bayesian analog of the confidence interval, and here 
specifies the COI bounds under which at least 95% of the posterior distribution lies. 
<b>NOTE</b>: if you see a "+" appended to the upper bound of your credible interval, 
that means that the upper bound is actually infinity. This behavior is due to the way 
COIL is implemented, and reflects the bounds specified during the construction of the 
prior distribution.
