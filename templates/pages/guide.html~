    <h3>Minor Allele Frequencies (MAFs)</h3>
    <h4>From Data</h4>
    <p>
      This option is only recommended for datasets with more than 250 samples. We also recommend that you enable MCMC
      when using this option, to better approximate the true MAFs present in your sampled population. 
    </p>
    <h4>From File</h4>
    <p>
      This option is recommended if validated MAFs are available for your dataset. The MAFs file should be formatted
      like <a href="/static/sample_files/coil_maf_test.csv">this sample</a>. In short, a <code>.csv</code> file, with 4 columns
      corresponding to an index (or barcode position id), the major allele, the minor allele and the minor allele frequency, 
      respectively. All lines that start with <code>#</code> will be ignored.
    </p>
    <h4>From <a href="https://www.malariagen.net/projects/pf3k">pf3k</a></h4>
    <p>
      This option is recommended for smaller datasets, where validated MAFs are not available. For this option, you must
      choose the geography relevant to your samples (listed in the dropdown), as well as submit a file specifying the genomic 
      positions of your SNP barcodes. The SNP loci file should be formatted like <a href="/static/sample_files/24_snp_barcode_loci.csv">this sample</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h3>SNP Barcodes</h3>
    <p>
      The SNP barcodes file should be formatted like <a href="/static/sample_files/coil_24_snp_barcode_test.txt">this sample</a>. In short, a 
      tab-delimited file with 2 columns, corresponding to the sample id and barcode, respectively. Like the SNP loci file, all lines starting 
      with <code>#</code> will be ignored. 
    </p>

  <h2>Output Formatting</h2>
  <p>
    The output is a <code>.csv</code> file with each row corresponding to either a sample (in the same order as the input)
    or a SNP loci position, with the sample rows listed first and the SNP loci listed second; and with columns corresponding
    to ids and predictions. In the case of the sample rows, the predictions are COI; in the case of the position rows, the
    predictions are MAFs (which may or may not be different than the input MAFs depending on whether MCMC approximation was
    enabled). See <a href="/static/sample_files/coil_result-mafs_from_pf3k_west_africa.csv">here</a> for a sample output file.
